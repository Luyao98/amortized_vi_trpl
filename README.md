# Amortized Variational Inference by Policy Search (AVIPS)

This repository contains the code and resources for my master's thesis, titled **"Amortized Variational Inference by Policy Search (AVIPS)."** The project focuses on developing and evaluating AVIPS, a new gradient-based inference algorithm that combines amortized variational inference with Gaussian Mixture of Experts and information geometric optimization. MA_final_Luyao_Deng.pptx gives a brief overview of my work.
